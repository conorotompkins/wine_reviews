##Wine Analysis score modeling

###Idea 1
- Use colors on bigram (one varietal per graph) to associate points with flavors
- Use a matrix to look at all varietals and run an algorithm on bigram to build a regression to see which ones are most commonly used based on scoring
- i.e. see how black currant is scored when used with cab vs chardonnay; chardonnay should have negative correlation while cab should have higher
- think about how N/A's will calculate...highly likely that no chardonnay will have black currant...
